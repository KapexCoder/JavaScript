# JavaScript Introduction

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to the website.
This happens in games, in the behaviour of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc.

# What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by ***Brendan Eich***.

- JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. ***With more experience***, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

- JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:
    1) Browser Application Programming Interfaces ([APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/API)) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.

    2) Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) or Facebook.

    3) Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.


To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is [the standard for introductory programming examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program).)
